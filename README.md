Additionally, it showcases how to validate form data using Spring Boot and Spring MVC.

## Features:
CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for database operations.
Validation: Learn how to validate form data using Spring Boot and Spring MVC.
Thymeleaf Integration: Utilize Thymeleaf as the template engine for server-side rendering.
